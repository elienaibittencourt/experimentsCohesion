        <p>This page is intended to provide all documents used in the experiments presented in the article "Experimental Evaluation of the Relation between Cohesion and Program Comprehension Effort" sent to 10th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures and Reuse <a href="http://cbsoft.org/sbcars2016">SBCARS 2016</a>. The article is in review stage.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Evaluation of the Relation between Cohesion and Program Comprehension Effort</strong></p>

<p>Cohesion can be defined as the degree to which a software module is focused on a since responsibility. Software engineering literature claims that the more cohesive a module is, the easier it will be to understand its source code. Researchers have defined a series of metrics for quantifying cohesion. However, there is no empirical evidence about the relationship between cohesion, quantified by metrics, and the effort for understanding programs. In this context, we conducted two quasi-experiments to evaluate the relation between cohesion measurements and the effort spent to understand the source code of classes in object-oriented software. Moreover, we evaluated whether two different types of metrics – structural and conceptual – presented distinct relation with comprehension effort. In our experiments, participants carried out tasks that required them to understand the source code of classes with different degrees of cohesion. Our findings showed that the cohesion did not impact on program comprehension. This occurred mainly because the much stronger influence of other source code properties thus minimizing the influence of cohesion.</p>
